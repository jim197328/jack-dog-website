<main class="content">
<p>From adventure-filled field walks to gentle care for seniors, I offer flexible dog walking and pet care services tailored to your furry friend's needs.</p>
<p>Walks are for all shapes and sizes and can be either on or off lead (where/when appropriate) with games, lots of interaction, lots of sniffing, playing and just being poochy - however works best. Typically to the fields and wide green spaces around the village where there are plenty of footpaths and spaces for running around and a circular walk of a couple of miles. Field walks stimulate a dog's natural instincts which improves both mental and physical levels. Each outing is a mini adventure to give your pet the best time with lots of variety so not just a pavement stroll each time - unless that is the preference!</p>
<p>Photo's and an update are sent to each individual owner after each walk so you know how much your pet enjoyed their walk, what fun they had and what they got up to and where. Happy to have a chat about anything else you need if not covered with the below.</p>

<h3>Solo Walks</h3>
<p class="price">£20.00 per Walk (1 hour)</p>
<p>One-to-one walk giving exclusive focus and full attention to your pet ensuring the very most enjoyment and fun is achieved during their walk. This is suited for all dogs including for one's who maybe need special attention or who are not entirely comfortable in groups, or are perhaps reactive to certain situations or things. Also really good for dogs whose pace is different to others, or suffering injury or just prefer to have some solo quality time.</p>
